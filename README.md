# Fantastic Umbrella

## Description
Fantastic Umbrella is a fictional e-commerce site, and this repo contains the guts. The stuff that makes it run. The back-end. Users of this application are able to view the shop's products in full, or filter the items by category, or tag. Users may also view single items when requested by id. Update, delete or create new items using Insomnia. The structure of this application need not only be applied to an e-commerce site. It's just a series of interconnected tables housing data. One could create a database containing every player in the NFL and group them by team, by position, whether they're on offense, defense or special teams etc.. And that, I believe is the biggest take away from this project: experience in building databases. Thanks for reading, and happy coding.
